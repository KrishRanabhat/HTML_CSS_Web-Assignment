<h1>Site Report</h1>

<p>My experience while learning about Web Development was really valuable, as I got to know about the concepts and building process of web pages and its design.
Intially, I did understand the basics of HTML and made simple web pages but, I felt stuck while trying to understand and execute CSS codes as i wasnt used to its code structure and had low
knowledge about proper implementation in webpage, as it was important for making webpages more lively and relevant. Eventhough, I had a slow start in terms of building a web page
by linking both HTML and CSS file, I somehow managed to clearly understand the concepts and create meaningful and clean website by consistently practicing and doing the tasks
given in our weekly study sessions. Through the tasks given in weekly study sessions, I learned to execute my understandings and resolve it by debugging the error in
codes.</p>

<h2>Wireframe Image</h2>
<div class = "wireframeimg">
<img src = "Image_Resources/wireframe.png" alt = "Wireframe" class = "webviewimg">
<img src = "Image_Resources/wireframe_two.png" alt = "Wireframe" class = "mobileviewimg">
</div>

<p>These series of interconnected webpages is my portfolio website. This portfolio website is designed by keeping two things in mind i.e. Simplicity and User-friendly.
The design of all of the websites are done with simple color grading and text animation to ensure formal and clear layout, so that user can easily understand about the webpage 
they are seeing on their screen. Also, consistency is given respect across all the webpages as the menu bar and the design envioronment is same in all. The important texts and
menu bar have a lively feedback with color and scale change animation. All these pages are designed according to the criteria given, in project page image placeholders are made
with grid display, contact page uses form and social media links and video demo page uses iframe to play video in an interface.</p>
